Learning Vector Representations of Bicycle Itineraries

Over the past ten years, bicycles have become an increasingly attractive transport
and leisure activity mode. As the number of cyclists tends to increase, there is a need
to improve their experience. Multiple techniques have already been created for solving
trip destination, travel time prediction, and other tasks. Most of the created models
were detached from the geographical semantic characteristics of the trips, making these
approaches bounded to city local patterns, they were trained. This work proposes the
bicycle itineraries vector representation technique based on the state-of-the-art Natural
Language Processing embedding method, using OpenStreetMap functional data and
Uber H3 map grid representation approach. There were used the Hex2vec and Document
embeddings techniques, to obtain the bike trajectory embeddings. In order to determine
the quality and accuracy of the new method, trained vectors were applied to solve
trip type classification and travel time prediction tasks. After numerous tests, the best
models were presented and analyzed, which showed satisfactory results.
